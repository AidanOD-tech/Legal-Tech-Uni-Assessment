        "\n",
        "Assume the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)  Four candidates interviewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "      To give them hypothetical names:  \n",
        "      \n",
        "          Vaughn Leland, Jeremy Wendell, Marilee Stone, Thornton McLeash\n",
        "\n",
        "2)  Candidates may have competing offers -- or not be willing to accept the position because of the amount of the salary.  It is therefore important to determine the rank the faculty collectively assigns to the candidates.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The top-ranked candidate should be first offered then job, if that person declines, the second-ranked person should be given the offer.  If that person declines, the third-ranked person should be given the offer.  And if that person declines, the fourth-ranked person should be given the offer.\n",

        "So we need to know the ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)  Each faculty member should be able email their encrypted votes to the faculty assistant.  Come up with a way for faculty members to create an encypted vote that the faculty assistant can decrypt.  This might involve both a encrypted message and a digital signature in the same message.\n",
        "\n",
        "3a) Alternatuve:  Create a Google Sheet that is accessible to anyone with the link.  Have Professors enter their encrypted votes (and perhaps digital signatures) there.  Then import that sheet much like we imported an excel spreadsheet -- which is a tad more complicated -- here are some possible methods:\n",

        "4)  Ideally, the faculty assistant would be to (a) ensure that the vote came from a faculty member; (b) the faculty member voted only once; and (c) no one is able to determine who voted for who.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)  So that faculty members don't waste their votes, multiple rounds of voting currently occur.  This is the current process at many schools:\n",

        "      a) In the first round, faculty members are asked to pick their top choice.  The winner is ranked the first-candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "      b) The winner of this first election is removed from the second ballot and faculty members are asked to make their selection of their most-preferred candidate among those that remain.  The winner of this round is ranked the second-candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "      c) The winner of the second round is removed from the final ballot and faculty members are asked to select which of the two remaining candidates they prefer.  The winner of this round is the third-candidate and the loser of this round is the fourth-candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)  Ideally, we would like to have only one act of voting in which the faculty member is asked on the ballot to identify a first, second, third, and fourth choice.  If you get bogged down on this phase, you may resort to multiple ballots -- it will still be faster than printing ballots that reflect the candidates who remain.\n",
        "\n",
